## 📋 Final Steps (5 minutes total)

### Step 1: Set Up Formspree (2 minutes)

**I need you to do this manually since I can't access the browser:**

1. Open your browser and go to: **https://formspree.io/register**
2. Sign up with your email or GitHub
3. Click "New Form" or "Create Form"
4. Name it "Portfolio Contact"
5. **Copy the Form ID** (looks like `xyzabc123`)
6. **Tell me your:**
   - Form ID: `_________________`
   - Email address: `_________________`

**I'll update the Contact.jsx file for you!**

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (3 minutes)

**Option A: Use the Deploy Script (Easiest)**

Just double-click the file: `deploy.bat`

It will:
- Install Vercel CLI
- Login to Vercel (opens browser)
- Deploy your portfolio
- Give you a live URL!

**Option B: Manual Commands**

Open PowerShell in this folder and run:

```powershell
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod

## 📧 Contact Form Setup

Once you give me your Formspree Form ID and email, I'll update:

Then you can redeploy with: `vercel --prod`
